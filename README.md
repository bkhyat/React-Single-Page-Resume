# React Single Page Resume

It's a resume app created using react typescript.
The Resume component creates a nice, attractive resume.

The data that the Resume component shows can directly be passed as a JSON, and it creates the Resume on the fly.

<hr>

The resume layout is currently opinionated, and is purely based on my own design decision and preferences.

# What's next?

The next version is going to introduce more resume templates based on the current one, and will include a form that can
be used to fill up all the data, and to create the resume on the go interactively.

Next version is also supposingly going to introduce more sections in resume, along with the ability to customize the
sections.
